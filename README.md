# elevator-game
A simple elevator management game made using JavaFX.

It was made using JDK 8. Java JDK versions aren't bundled with JavaFX anymore since JDK 11. It's probably possible to make it work with newer JDKs though, as JavaFX is still being developed independently but I didn't really use JavaFX since this project so I'm not a 100% sure about that process. Feel free trying to build it with newer JDKs. If you are interested in it feel free to contact me about it.

It was one of my university projects and I still like the idea of a game like this. I might do a remake of it using Unity in the future.

The comments are (sadly) in Hungarian.
